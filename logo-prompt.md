Generate a logo for a web application called "Eventide Tracker". The app is used for tracking event finances (income, expenses), donations, and experiences.

**Key Concepts to Convey:**
*   **Reflection & Insight:** The name "Eventide" suggests twilight, a time for reflection. The logo should feel calm, wise, and insightful.
*   **Tracking & Growth:** It should visually hint at tracking data, like finances and experiences, leading to growth or understanding.
*   **Events & Finance:** A subtle nod to gatherings and financial management is a plus.

**Visual Style:**
*   **Overall Style:** Minimalist, modern, clean, and professional. Use simple, elegant lines and abstract shapes. It should be suitable for use as an app icon.
*   **Iconography (choose one or combine two ideas subtly):**
    1.  **Abstract "E":** A stylized letter 'E' that incorporates a simple bar chart or a gentle wave within its form.
    2.  **Twilight Chart:** A simple line graph that forms a gentle hill or wave, with a small, soft crescent moon or a single star above it, representing "eventide" and "insight."
    3.  **Path & Spark:** An icon showing a simple, winding path (representing an event's journey) that ends in a small, glowing spark (representing the insights or summary).
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Use a primary color of **soft lavender (#D0BFFF)**.
    *   Use an accent color of **muted teal (#73A9AD)**.
    *   The logo should look good on both a light gray (#F5F5F5) and a dark background.
*   **Typography (for versions with text):**
    *   The text "Eventide Tracker" should be placed below or to the right of the icon.
    *   Use a clean, elegant sans-serif font similar to 'Belleza' or 'Montserrat'.

**Output Requirements:**
*   Generate 4-6 distinct logo concepts based on this prompt.
*   Provide each logo on a plain, solid background (both light and dark versions if possible).
*   Ensure the design is a vector-style graphic, not a photorealistic image.
*   The final icon should be clear and recognizable even at small sizes.
